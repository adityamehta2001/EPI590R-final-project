This is my final project analysis for the EPI 590R pre-term course ("R Bootcamp") at the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health. To reproduce my analysis, please run 
Final Project Analysis.R and then render Final Project Analysis.qmd to obtain the Quarto document I created. Both of these files can be found in the R folder in my EPI590R final-project repo that has been committed and pushed to GitHub.
